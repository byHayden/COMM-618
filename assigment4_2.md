# In-Class Assignment IV.II: A Database I Wish Existed

Dear Editor, 

Whenever a bill is debated on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties are granted time to argue, debate, convince, posture, or lobby for a given piece of legislation. Most of the time, party leadership (Pete Aguilar on the Democratic side, for instance), speaks first, often yielding to their colleagues for further debate. But does the seniority, gender, or geographic constituency of the first non-leader speaker in a floor debate impact the likelihood of a bill passing the chamber? 

Here are the variables I’d seek to collect to see if there's any correlation between floor debate and successful bill passage:
- The date of a given floor debate and the bill being debated;
- The name and constituency of the first speaker in a floor debate (i.e. Matt Gaetz from Florida’s 1st congressional district); 
- The seniority of the first speaker (i.e. Rep. Chip Roy is in his second term in Congress);
- The gender of the first speaker; 
- The vote total of a given bill and whether or not it passed the House (i.e. This bill passed the House with 289 votes)

I will collect the data by watching portions of floor debates from significant House bills on C-SPAN and recording the information based on the sequence of events in the debate. I will also verify members’ seniority, congressional district, and the success of a given bill from official congressional records on Congress.gov.

Happy Saturday!
