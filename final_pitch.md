# COMM-618: Final Project — Pitch

Ever since the landmark Supreme Court case _Citizens United v. FEC_ was handed down in 2010, campaign finance has come into sharp focus in American politics, dividing the political and working class alike and leading to a plethora of moral and ethical debates. I would like to probe the relationship between campaign finance at the federal level — in terms of average campaign contribution, total campaign fundraising, and the industry of top donors to individual congressional campaigns — and ideology in the U.S. House of Representatives. In essence, I’m curious as to whether there is a reasonable and noticeable correlation between campaign contributions and legislative decision-making in the nation’s chief legislative body. 

I will gather campaign finance data from [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress), [the Federal Elections Commission (FEC)](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=processed&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022), and [the Campaign Finance Institute](http://www.cfinst.org/federal/congress.aspx) and compare the extracted figures with ideological divergence among the House’s most liberal, most conservative, and most “moderate” members in the 117th Congress, which ran from 2021 to 2023. (In order to ensure the sample is diverse and representative, I will also select 20 random House members regardless of ideology or party.) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests will be made in the event that the FEC does not have sufficient open campaign finance data. 

I will then tally and weight ideology scores using metrics from the nonpartisan [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2020/house/ideology), the conservative think tank [Heritage Action](https://heritageaction.com/scorecard/117), and the left-leaning tracking website [Progressive Punch](https://progressivepunch.org/scores.htm?house=house&party=&sort=overall-lifetime&order=down), and supplement the comparative analysis with interviews with campaign finance and political science experts who can contextualize the financial and political landscape.
