While partisan fireworks have lit up Congress in modern American politics, the 116th Congress — which ran from January 2019 to January 2021 — featured several members who bucked their parties’ ideological trends, according to selected ideology scores from the website GovTrack. The scores, which are calculated by an analysis of roll call votes and bill sponsorship, are assigned to each member of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, where a score of 1 is most conservative and 0 is most liberal. 

In particular, four Democrats — Antonio Delagdo (N.Y.), Stephanie Murphy (Fla.), Kurt Schrader (Ore.), and Xochitl Torres Small (N.M.) — were more conservative than the most liberal Republican, while two Republicans — Kevin McCarthy and Mike Garcia, both of California — were more liberal than the most conservative Democrat. Only McCarthy and Garcia represent districts that are highly partisan, with the aforementioned moderate Democrats serving regions that are electorally competitive, according to their Cook Police Report voting indices. 

Geographically speaking, all 10 of the most liberal Democrats represent states that President Joe Biden won in 2020, while eight of the 10 most conservative Republicans come from states that Donald Trump carried in his failed bid for reelection. Both of the conservative Republicans who come from states that Trump did not win — Paul Gosar and Debbie Lesko — represent constituencies in the crucial swing state of Arizona. 

Despite this apparent moderation in Congress, the United States has become more polarized over the last 40 years than any other developed democracy, [according to a 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26669). The 116th Congress, which featured both a Democrat-controlled Senate and a Democratic House, was [historically productive](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/briefing/congress-productive-democrats-republicans.html) and was described as “highly significant” by [The Washington Post’s Sarah Binder](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/29/congress-year-review/). It passed 344 pieces of legislation, 18 less than its successor.
