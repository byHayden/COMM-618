# In-Class Assignment I: A Class in Data
While diverse in our cinematic preferences, the eight-person cohort is relatively homogenous in its lack of familiarity with SQL and scripting, minus one notable expert exception. In fact, the all quantitative questions on data expertise included a full range of competencies because of one select expert data journalist.

In addition, several members of the class have had journalistic work published, including our instructor, [Theo Francis](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/theo-francis), whose work is regularly published in one of the nation's most-read newspapers. Little else was discovered about this topic, however. 

Finally, our class has limited — or non-existent — knowledge of the following data tools and scripting languages, as evidenced by a 0.0 median in familiarity:
- R;
- Python pandas; and
- C++.

I look forward to analyzing more data and learning more about both our class and the journalistic landscape within which we all operate!
