# Money buys access in Congress, but does it impact votes in the House?

### Analysis of campaign finance data from the 2018 midterm election cycle reveals that Democrats received lower median campaign contributions than their Republican congressional counterparts. 

When Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ran for president in 2016, he often boasted about how his campaign was funded by a large number of small donations rather than a small number of large donations. Hillary Clinton, against whom he was running for the Democratic nomination, was financed and controlled by “big money donors,” he said.

Sanders, a left-leaning populist who ran on an anti-establishment platform, claimed that his low average campaign contribution was evidence of his man-of-the-people authenticity and, by extension, his commitment to progressive causes. [Sanders’ progressive](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/998962319551090688?s=20) [acolytes have used similar tactics](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/22/925892007/fundraging-fuels-democratic-money-advantage-over-gop-in-most-races) over the years, wedging small, individual donations into stump speeches and ads throughout their campaigns. 

But, median campaign contributions for U.S. House campaigns are not necessarily indicative of strident ideology positions, according to an analysis of campaign contributions from the 2018 election. Instead, partisan affiliation is a more robust predictor of campaign contribution amounts, with Democrats garnering smaller median campaign contributions than their Republican counterparts, according to data obtained from the nonpartisan organization OpenSecrets. 

Five of the 10 most liberal Democrats —Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) among them — had median campaign contributions under $500, while none of the ten most conservative Republicans had median figures under that threshold. Of the 10 most ideologically strident members of the House, three averaged donations of over $800, all of them Republicans from red states. 

The elasticity of a particular electoral district may also contribute to more active, engaged, and local individual donors. Several House members who represented competitive districts — former Reps. Xochitl Torres Small (D-N.M.), Antonio Delgado (D-N.Y.), Dave Loebsack (D-Iowa), and Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) among them — had low median campaign contributions and represented districts that The Cook Political Report deemed close during the 2018 campaign.   

Michael Rocca, a political science scholar at the University of New Mexico who has written extensively about campaign finance and congressional politics, said that money does not influence or “buy” congressional votes in the traditional sense. Instead of directly buying votes from “gettable” members, he said, campaign contributions tend to cement political position-taking, ensuring that politicians do not waver in their support or opposition for a specific piece of legislation.

“Giving you money does not mean that you are changing your vote in my direction,” Rocca said. “All it means is that I’m giving you money because you are more likely to vote that way anyway.”

Still, money undoubtedly buys access to politicians, Rocca said. Indeed, the hydrocarbon company Devon Energy was the largest donor to Representative-turned Senator Markwayne Mullin’s (R-Okla.) re-election campaign; Mullin, in turn, was one of the oil industry’s most vocal supporters in the House during the proceding legislative session, advocating ardently for increased oil production. 

Similar influence was also apparently exerted on Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who backed efforts to expand railway infrastructure and curb real estate regulation, respectively, after receiving massive donations from lobbyists and interest groups in those industries. 

Representatives with leadership roles also saw larger median donations than their backbencher colleagues in 2018, with then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) bringing in an average campaign contribution of $1,750 and Republican Study Committee chair Bill Flores (R-Texas) averaging $1,009 per donation.

As fundraising operations become more sophisticated — and, in the wake of domination from so-called “dark money” groups, more shady — regulation of campaign donations and political actions committees (PACs) is becoming all the more crucial. The Federal Elections Commission — the independent government agency responsible for enforcing the nation’s campaign finance laws — is anticipating another expensive and tangled cycle in 2024, according to spokesperson Judtih Ingram. 

“Presidential election-year cycles always bring higher fundraising and spending than other cycles,” Ingram said, “and we expect the 2023-24 cycle to be no exception.”

Fundraising in the 2022 cycle was over 70 percent higher than in the 2018 cycle, Ingram said. [According to OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/11/total-cost-of-2022-state-and-federal-elections-projected-to-exceed-16-7-billion/), over $16.5 billion was spent during the 2022 midterm election cycle, even as the FEC has been described as [“toothless,”](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fec-left-toothless-empty-seats-heading-2020/story?id=65215840) [“in disarray,”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/18/stymied-by-polarized-agency-fec-chair-ellen-weintraub-finds-her-voice-trump-critic/) [“feckless”](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/opinion/the-feckless-fec-rebuked.html) and, in a particularly scathing piece from [the Harvard Law Review,](https://harvardlawreview.org/2018/03/eliminating-the-fec-the-best-hope-for-campaign-finance-regulation/) “exacts a high opportunity cost, occupying a space in the regulatory landscape that could be filled by more motivated and functional actors.”

“The FEC will continue to enforce federal campaign finance law and Commission regulations,” Ingram added. 

Still, campaign finance reform is a hot-button issue in Washington, D.C., with [activist groups](https://endcitizensunited.org/) [and nonprofits](https://campaignlegal.org/issues/campaign-finance) popping up to fight the issue and members of Congress periodically broaching the topic in legislative work. [Advocates in state legislatures](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/01/campaign-finance-advocates-pressure-virginia-general-assembly/) across the country are pushing for comprehensive campaign finance reform, but little has materialized at the federal level. 

Rocca said that repealing or reforming Citizens United v. FEC — a landmark Supreme Court decision that struck down a host of campaign finance restrictions and made way for the creation of “super PACs” — is the first step to creating a more open and transparent system of financing increasingly pricey campaigns. 

However, he cautions that campaign disclosures, which are currently required under federal election laws, are more important than the proliferation of PAC money, since it allows the public to see where candidates are getting their campaign funds. 

“It’s probably the most important hurdle,” Rocca said of repealing Citizens United. “But, I am less concerned about the amount of spending than I am with the fact that we need disclosure. We need to know where this money is coming from.” 

“There’s not enough consensus on Capitol Hill to do anything about Citizens United,” he added.

Until such time as Citizens United is reformed — or comprehensive campaign finance reform is passed in Congress — American voters are likely to experience a barrage of campaign advertisements, emails, and push notifications as the country approaches the next election cycle. While the troves of money being dumped into campaigns hasn’t appeared to benefit one party over the other, it nevertheless has an enormous impact on the decisions elected officials make once they enter public service.

**Methodology:** In order to obtain a representative sample of members of the U.S. House of Representatives, I used GovTrack’s ideology score from the 116th Congress — which ran from Jan. 3, 2019 to Jan. 3, 2021 — and pulled the names of the 10 most liberal, 10 most conservative, and 10 most “moderate” (centrist) members. Then, I randomly generated 20 numbers between 1 and 435 to choose random members to ensure a balanced and representative sample. Then, I obtained complete campaign finance logs from all 50 of those candidates’ campaigns in 2018, except for Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) who, while one of the most moderate members of the House, was elected in a special election and thus did not have available campaign finance data. Then, I cleaned the data and separated the logs [into ten Google Sheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/17cq3fEbnIdhDww_D6BtCxZcBMIHP02eO), after which I calculated the median and average campaign contribution for all 50 candidates. Finally, those figures were aggregated in [an overarching dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1irgbj-6gA_bScCyxalKfcalIISttxk0nV-lqk4bxVHU/edit#gid=0), and analyzed for use in the above story. All charts were generated in Microsoft Excel, and all medians and average were calculated in Google Sheets using their respective functions.
