# In-Class Assignment III: Dig-In Story Based on Trump Sheet

### Congressional campaigns spend thousands at Trump properties ahead of midterm elections

Six congressional hopefuls and 30 incumbent Republican lawmakers disbursed campaign funds to properties owned by President Donald Trump between January 2017 and February 2018, totalling over $68,000, according to records from the Federal Elections Commission. 

Of the six non-incumbent individuals running for Congress who hosted a fundraiser at a Trump venue in or around the midterm elections, only one — Greg Pence of Indiana, the older brother of Vice President Mike Pence — won their race. On the incumbent side, 17 candidates who spent money at Trump properties were successful in holding their seats, including staunch Trump allies Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.). 

Several candidates — including the high-profile perennial candidate Omar Navarro from California who twice has attempted to unseat prominent Democratic lawmaker Maxine Waters — held multiple events at Trump properties over the course of several months. 

“QUOTE GOES HERE,” said Frank Acomb, a spokesperson for Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), who was among those to fundraise at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. Reed was ultimately successful in his bid for a fifth term in the House. 

In addition, groups associated with the America First Political Action Conference — which was founded by white nationalist Nick Fuentes — spent a combined $93,000 on 11 separate disbursements, all but one of which were in the nation’s capital.

Added Francine Proulx of nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute: “QUOTE GOES HERE.”

Notably, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has long been one of Trump’s most vocal Republican critics in the upper chamber, spent nearly $1,100 on lodging at the aforementioned Trump hotel in D.C. [Corker did not seek reelection in 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/politics/tennessees-bob-corker-announces-retirement-from-senate.html) and was succeeded by fellow Republican Marsha Blackburn. 

“QUOTE GOES HERE,” said John Doe, Corker’s press secretary.

In total, the Trump properties in Washington and New York City racked up over $700,000 in disbursements, the documents show, though all funds paid to the New York property were listed as rent payments from Trump’s presidential campaign. 

[According to TIME](https://time.com/4629308/donald-trump-business-deals-world-map/#Argentina), there are more than 500 businesses in over two-dozen countries worldwide bearing Trump’s name.

_Methodology_: I imported the data from the posted .CSV, cleaned it accordingly, and then filtered the data by committee name, isolating those that included the terms “for Congress” and “for Senate.” Then, I took the sums of the values associated with those two search terms. I also created a separate sheet containing the unique Congress-related payees and recipients and researched whether they were incumbent members of Congress and whether they eventually won their races. [Click here to see the spreadsheet from which I extracted the facts and figures used in this story.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_HjzC5GXbhK1yHdIdYsnlgGrIeA_PDUZ1ZzoKbru_sY/edit?usp=sharing)
