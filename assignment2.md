# In-Class Assignment II: Data, Data, and Data, Oh My!

Dear Editor,

I'm looking to research the potential correlation between vaccination rates and recent voting behavior in the state of Virginia. 
In doing preliminary research on the topic, I found [a dataset from the Virginia Open Data Portal ](https://data.virginia.gov/Government/VDH-COVID-19-PublicUseDataset-Vaccine-Phase-By-Hea/hjhd-yn2m) 
that provides phase-by-phase vaccination numbers by locality and health district across the state. 
Given its nature and source, this dataset is clearly reliable and needs little to no further vetting. 

With this data in hand, I plan to cross-reference statistical outliers contained within this dataset with precinct-level voting data in the 
2022 midterm elections to see if there is a significant correlation between partisan affiliation — that is to say Republican 
and Democratic registration in various counties and municipalities — and vaccination rates. 

Not only is this dataset verifiable and detailed, it is also easy to filter — it has many downloadable subsets that are organized by county — and 
includes the contact information for the owner of the database, so I can contact the state should there be any questions or concerns relating to 
the dataset, its source, scope, or organization. Furthermore, it is broken down by vaccination phase — that is to say the COVID-19 vaccine's 
first dose, second dose, etc... — which is a useful criteria that further divides the dataset. 

I could also expand this data examination to include similar relationships in the nearby states of West Virginia and Maryland, both of which 
have official and verifiable open data portals. (Precinct-level data is relatively ubiquitous across the United States, so voter behavior would
likewise be easy to obtain in those states as well as Virginia.) 

Happy Saturday!
