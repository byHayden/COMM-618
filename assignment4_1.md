Dear Public Records Officer or Coordinator,

Pursuant to the state open records law Cal. Gov't Code Secs. 6250 through 6276.48, I write to request access to and a copy of all financial, administrative, logistical, and personnel records pertaining to election and candidacy fillings for the upcoming election for the United States Senate in the year 2024. If your agency does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian's name and address.

I agree to pay any reasonable copying and postage fees of not more than $10. If the cost would be greater than this amount, please notify me. Please provide a receipt indicating the charges for each document.

As provided in the open records law, Sec. 6253(c), I will expect your response within ten (10) business days.

If you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.

I would note that willful violation of the open records law can result in the award of court costs and reasonable attorney fees. See Sec. 6259(d).

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Hayden Godfrey
